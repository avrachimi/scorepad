# ScorePad - Track Your Padel Matches

I wanted to build something that would cover a few areas I wanted to learn more about.
The idea was to design the app in figma, think of the database and api requirements, code the backend and
then create the app.

#### Technologies I'm using for different parts of the project
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Backend**: Go with Chi and sqlc
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 

This is definitely not a production ready app and it's not meant to be.
